Title: 

Clean Status Bar

Short description:

Taking clean, distraction free screenshots has never been so easy

Full description:

Tired of Photoshopping out notifications/low battery to make a nice, clean status bar for the Play Store? Run this app first - it draws over your status bar, showing a full battery and clock, and optionally WiFi/3G icons.

It runs as a service, so you can move to other apps to take screenshots. This app is aimed at developers, not general users - it is not a status bar replacement!

Please note:

- This app is to help you take consistent screenshots, <b>the time is not supposed to update</b>
- Transparency is impossible: we draw over the existing status bar in order to have a clean one


This app is open source - check it out/contribute at https://github.com/emmaguy/clean-status-bar
